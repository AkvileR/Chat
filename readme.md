# How to use
For the program to work you need to **launch the server** first. Afterwards you can launch multiple client applications.

**Input your username** and **pick a chat** room from the list. A default room is provided, but you can make more if you wish. Other users will see the newly added rooms only if their application is launched after adding the room.

In the new window press **connect** and you will be connected to the room. From there you can send a *group message* to everyone in the room or a *private message* to a person from the list. To send a private message make sure to update the list, select a person and click send.
